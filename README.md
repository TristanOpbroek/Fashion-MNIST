### Fashion MNIST Autoencoder & MLP Classification

This project demonstrates dimensionality reduction and classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset. Fashion MNIST is a collection of 28x28 pixel images representing different types of wearable clothing. 
To accurately classify this dataset, an Autoencoder is used to compress the image representation down to 64 features, from 784, which is then used to train a simple Logistic Regression classifier, as well as a fully connected multilayer perceptron classifier.
